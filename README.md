## <a name="about"></a>üìñ About This Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my solutions to a variety of algorithmic problems sourced from renowned competitive programming platforms like **LeetCode** and **Beecrowd** (formerly URI Online Judge). It showcases a dedicated effort to hone problem-solving skills, explore diverse data structures, and implement efficient algorithms primarily in Java, with some explorations in Python.

The problems tackled span a wide range of complexities and categories, demonstrating a commitment to continuous learning and a passion for algorithmic challenges. Each solution is approached with a focus on clarity, efficiency, and adherence to best practices.

## <a name="structure"></a>üèõÔ∏è Repository Structure

The repository is meticulously organized to ensure clarity and ease of navigation. Solutions are primarily categorized by the platform they originate from, and then further by algorithmic or data structure paradigms.

**Key Directories:**

* **`src/main/java/beecrowd/`**: Contains solutions for problems from the Beecrowd platform. Each problem typically resides in its own subdirectory, often including a `Main.java` file for Java solutions or a Python script (`.py`). Some may include a specific `README.md` detailing the problem.
* **`src/main/java/leetcode/`**: Houses solutions for LeetCode challenges. This section is further subdivided into:
    * **`algorithms/`**: Solutions categorized by the primary algorithmic technique employed (e.g., `binary_search`, `dynamic_programming`, `math`).
    * **`data_structures/`**: Solutions focused on the application or manipulation of specific data structures (e.g., `array`, `string`, `hash_table`).
        * The `array` solutions are often further refined by the specific approach used, such as `two_pointers`, `sliding_window`, or a `default_approach`.

This structured approach allows for a granular understanding of the types of problems solved and the techniques applied.

## <a name="highlights"></a>üåü Technical Highlights & Skills Demonstrated

This repository is a testament to proficiency in several key areas of software development and algorithmic thinking:

* **Strong Grasp of Core Data Structures:** Solutions frequently employ fundamental data structures such as:
    * Arrays (and various traversal/manipulation techniques like two-pointers, sliding windows)
    * Strings and their manipulation
    * Hash Tables (HashMaps) for efficient lookups and frequency counting
    * Linked Lists (singly-linked, cycle detection, merging)
    * Stacks (e.g., for parenthesis validation)
    * Heaps (Priority Queues for problems like pathfinding)
    * Matrices
* **Algorithmic Proficiency:** Implementation of a wide array of algorithms, including:
    * Sorting (often as a preliminary step, e.g., `Arrays.sort()`)
    * Binary Search for efficient searching in sorted datasets
    * Greedy Algorithms for optimization problems
    * Dynamic Programming for solving complex problems by breaking them into smaller, overlapping subproblems
    * Bit Manipulation for efficient subset generation or operations
    * Mathematical reasoning and number theory
* **Problem-Solving Acumen:** Deconstructing complex problem statements, identifying constraints, and formulating effective, optimized solutions. This is evident in the variety of problems tackled, from string manipulations and array-based challenges to graph-like traversals (implied in problems like "Find Minimum Time to Reach Last Room I") and combinatorial tasks.
* **Code Quality and Readability:** Emphasis on writing clean, well-commented and understandable Java code. Solutions often include:
    * Clear Javadoc comments explaining the purpose of classes and methods.
    * Descriptive variable and method names.
    * Inclusion of test cases (`main` methods with `test` or `testCase` helpers) within the solution files themselves to verify correctness and demonstrate usage.
* **Attention to Edge Cases:** Solutions consistently consider and address edge cases (e.g., empty inputs, nulls, single-element arrays, specific constraints mentioned in problem descriptions).
* **Efficiency Considerations:** Awareness of time and space complexity, often exploring or mentioning more optimal approaches (e.g., O(1) space rotations, O(n) vs O(n log n) for duplicate checks, or comparing a first attempt with a more optimized one).

## <a name="usage"></a>üöÄ How to Explore

1.  **Browse by Platform:**
    * Navigate to `src/main/java/leetcode/` for LeetCode solutions.
    * Navigate to `src/main/java/beecrowd/` for Beecrowd solutions.
2.  **Browse by Concept:**
    * Within the `leetcode` directory, explore subdirectories under `algorithms/` or `data_structures/` based on your interest.
3.  **Examine Individual Solutions:**
    * Each `Solution.java` (or `Main.java` for Beecrowd) file typically contains:
        * A Javadoc comment block linking to the problem description.
        * The implemented solution(s).
        * A `main` method with test cases to run and verify the solution.
    * For some Beecrowd problems, a dedicated `README.md` might provide the problem statement in English or Portuguese.
